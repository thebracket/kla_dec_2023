# The Rust Ecosystem

In this section, we're going to walk through a lot of the Rust ecosystem to help you get a feel for how Rust projects are structured, the tooling that is available, and key differences from C++.

In this section, we'll be covering:

* A quick introduction to the Rust toolchain and swiss-army knife *Cargo*.
* Some basic Rust syntax and how it differs from C++.
* Rust's safety guarantees and what they mean, including:
    * The borrow checker
    * Lifetimes
    * Reference counting
    * Data-race protection
    * Opt-in vs opt-out safety
* Program layout with workspaces, crates, programs and libraries
* Unit testing
* Dependency Management
* Benchmarking
