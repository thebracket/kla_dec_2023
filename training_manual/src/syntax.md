# Rust Syntax 101

We'll take a quick and fast dive through some of Rust's syntax differences from C++. Most of the building blocks are the same, but the conventions are different.

We'll be covering:

* Hello, World!
    * This is mostly an exercise to make sure that your Rust environments are setup correctly.
    * We'll compare C++ and Rust versions of the same program.
* Functions
* Variables
* Scopes
* Type Conversion
* Expressions and Return Values
* Overflow and Wrapping
* Structures
* Associated Functions
* Methods
* Arrays
* Vectors
